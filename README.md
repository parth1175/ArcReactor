# ArcReactor

The goal was to Design and create an Iron Man Arc reactor as a part of a Halloween 2021 costume


Parts used: 

Atmega328p microcontroller (Chip shortage made it impossible to get my hands on anything else)
7805 Voltage regulators
LEDS, Resistors, Capacitors
Crystal Oscillator 
Potentiometer
Perf Circuit Board and Soldering Equiptment

Testing Equiptment:

Multimeter
Waveform Generator and Oscilloscope 


Roadblocks:
- Lack of supplies
- Time constraints 
- Supply chain issues and shipping delays 



Steps:
1) Arc Reactor Design retrived from youtuber. It was 3D printed, Time constriants did not allow me to customize the design much. 
2) Perf circuit board was prepared and circuit was pre-designed to fit inside the 3d design. Wasn't able to order a PCB
3) Circuit was constructured, keeping space limitations in mind. 
4) .....

Ultimately, Accidiently blew the LEDS during testing phase. Got too excited and wired the 9V power sources directly to the LED ;(
